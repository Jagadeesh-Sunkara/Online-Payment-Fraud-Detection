# Online Payments Fraud Detection with Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent online payment transactions using machine learning techniques. By analyzing transaction data, we aim to identify patterns and features that indicate fraudulent behavior, ultimately enabling the creation of models that can predict and flag fraudulent transactions in real-time.

## Introduction

Online payment fraud is a significant concern in today's digital economy. Fraudulent activities not only result in financial losses for businesses but also erode customer trust. This project leverages machine learning algorithms to detect and prevent fraud in online payment systems.

## Hypothesis / Business Use

We hypothesize that certain transaction patterns and features, such as transaction amount, type, and balance information, are indicative of fraud. By identifying these patterns, we can build a model to predict and flag fraudulent transactions. This can help businesses minimize financial losses and protect their customers.

## Approach

1. **Data Collection**: Gather transaction data, including various features that may be relevant to fraud detection.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Process the raw data to handle missing values, outliers, and incorrect data types.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze the data to understand the distribution of features and identify any patterns or correlations.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features or modify existing ones to improve model performance.
5. **Model Building**: Train multiple machine learning models to predict fraudulent transactions.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Assess the performance of the models using appropriate metrics and choose the best-performing model.
7. **Implementation**: Deploy the model to a real-time system for fraud detection.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- IPython

## Data Source

The dataset used for this project can be sourced from publicly available online payment transaction datasets, such as the one used in the [Kaggle credit card fraud detection competition](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jainilcoder/online-payment-fraud-detection).

## Data Set

- **step**: Unit of time in which the transaction occurred.
- **type**: Type of transaction (e.g., PAYMENT, TRANSFER, CASH_OUT).
- **amount**: Amount of the transaction.
- **nameOrig**: Customer ID of the originator.
- **oldbalanceOrg**: Initial balance before the transaction.
- **newbalanceOrig**: New balance after the transaction.
- **nameDest**: Customer ID of the recipient.
- **oldbalanceDest**: Initial balance of the recipient before the transaction.
- **newbalanceDest**: New balance of the recipient after the transaction.
- **isFraud**: Indicator if the transaction is fraudulent.
- **isFlaggedFraud**: Indicator if the transaction is flagged as fraudulent.

## Data Cleaning

The data cleaning process involves:
- Removing or imputing missing values.
- Converting categorical variables to numeric.
- Handling outliers.
- Normalizing or scaling numeric features.

## Key Implementations

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Perform EDA to understand the distribution and relationships of the features. Visualizations include:
- Histograms
- Box plots
- Correlation heatmaps

### Model Building and Results

We use various machine learning models to detect fraudulent transactions:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- XGBoost Classifier

Each model is trained and evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC score.

### Source Code

The source code for this project is available in [Fraud_Detection notebook](https://github.com/Jagadeesh-Sunkara/Online-Payment-Fraud-Detection).The Fraud_Detection notebook includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and model training and evaluation.

## Lessons Learned

- Feature engineering plays a crucial role in improving model performance.
- Imbalanced datasets require careful handling, such as using techniques like SMOTE or adjusting class weights.
- Ensemble methods and boosting algorithms tend to perform better in detecting fraud due to their ability to capture complex patterns.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how machine learning can be effectively used to detect and prevent online payment fraud. By leveraging various algorithms and techniques, we can build robust models that help businesses safeguard their financial transactions.
